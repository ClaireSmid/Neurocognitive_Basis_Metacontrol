## Reinforcement learning models
The folder 'CompModel' contains the scripts to run the reinforcement learning models. The wrapper function assumes a folder structure (e.g. the likelihood models organised in a folder titled 'helper_functions') to be able to run as is. 

## Cortical thickness analysis
the matlab file contains the analysis for cortical thickness included in the paper. The analysis uses the surfstat Matlab package (link in main folder).

## Other
The folder 'LOOCV_Regression' contains regression models coded in Python and ran using Jupyter Notebook to find the best predicting executive function measures for model-based decision making and metacontrol. This analysis was not included in the final paper.
