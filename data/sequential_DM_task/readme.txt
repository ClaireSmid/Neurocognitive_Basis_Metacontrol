## Data from the sequential decision making (two-step) task

File created: 25/08/2022 

Data was collected as part of a larger psychological batter (e.g. alongside the data from the executive function tasks), and as part of a training paradigm (three testing sessions). Due to Covid (from March 2020 until Jul 2021) data collection of the sequential decision making task was halted, leading to a much smaller sample at the second testing session and no data for the final (third) time point. For the current paper, only data at the first timepoint was analysed, however, data from the first and second session were imputed to add one more participant to the pre-training timepoint who had completed the sequential task at the second session but was unable to complete it at the first session. 

The imputation procedure is included in the analysis folder in the R script. The data from the second time point was not further used for the current paper, and only the data from the first time point analysed.
